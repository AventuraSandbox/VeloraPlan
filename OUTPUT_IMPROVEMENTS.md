## Usage

### Automatic Generation
The enhanced output files are automatically generated when running the main application:
```bash
python -m veloraplan.main
```

### Manual Extraction
You can also run the extraction script manually:
```bash
python extract_outputs.py
```

### Output Location
All files are saved in the `outputs/` directory with timestamped filenames for version control.

## Technical Implementation

The improvements are implemented in `extract_outputs.py` with:
